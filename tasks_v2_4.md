## PR-17: TypingService Unit Tests

### Meta Information
- **Dependencies:** PR-2
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Branch:** `feature/pr-17-typing-service-tests`

### Objective
Write comprehensive unit tests for TypingService to ensure reliability and catch regressions.

### File to Create

**File:** `swift_demoTests/TypingServiceTests.swift`

Create comprehensive unit tests for TypingService covering:

**Test Categories:**
1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Test startTyping broadcasts status to Firebase
   - Test stopTyping removes status
   
2. **Debouncing**
   - Test rapid calls are debounced (limited writes)
   - Verify only broadcasts after 500ms delay
   
3. **Timeout**
   - Test typing status auto-removes after 5 seconds
   - Verify timeout is cancelled if user continues typing
   
4. **Multiple Users**
   - Test observeTypingUsers returns all typing users
   - Test current user excluded from results
   - Verify real-time updates via Combine publisher
   
5. **Format Typing Text**
   - Test 1 user: "Alice is typing..."
   - Test 2 users: "Alice and Bob are typing..."
   - Test 3+ users: "Alice and 2 others are typing..."
   - Test empty array returns nil
   
6. **Cleanup**
   - Test cleanup removes typing status
   - Verify works across multiple conversations

**Setup/Teardown:**
- Initialize TypingService and Combine cancellables in setUp
- Clean up resources in tearDown

### Files Created
- `swift_demoTests/TypingServiceTests.swift`

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Tests cover core functionality
- [ ] Tests run in < 10 seconds

### Files to Create

**File:** `swift_demoTests/ImageUploadServiceTests.swift`

Create comprehensive unit tests for ImageUploadService covering:

**Test Categories:**
1. **Upload Success**
   - Test successful upload returns valid Firebase URL
   - Verify URL contains expected format
   - Check progress reaches 100% completion

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Test progress updates fire during upload
   - Verify all states: preparing, compressing, uploading, completed

**ImageCompressor Tests:**
1. **Compression**
   - Test 2000x2000 image compresses to ~1MB
   - Verify compressed data is valid UIImage data
   - Check size reduction

2. **Resize**

## PR-19: Firebase Setup Documentation

### Meta Information
- **Dependencies:** PR-1, PR-4
- **Priority:** Low
- **Branch:** `feature/pr-19-firebase-docs`

### Objective
Create comprehensive documentation for setting up Firebase Realtime Database and Storage.

### File to Create

**File:** `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`

```markdown
# Firebase Setup Guide

## Overview
MessageAI uses three Firebase services:
1. **Firestore** - Message and conversation storage (already configured)
2. **Realtime Database** - Typing indicators (ephemeral data)
3. **Storage** - Image and profile picture hosting

## Prerequisites
- Firebase project created
- iOS app registered in Firebase Console
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` downloaded and added to project
- Xcode 15+ installed

---

## Part 1: Firebase Realtime Database

### Step 1: Create Database
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Build** → **Realtime Database**
4. Click **Create Database**
5. Choose database location (use same region as Firestore for consistency)
6. Start in **locked mode** (we'll add rules next)

### Step 2: Configure Security Rules
1. In Realtime Database console, go to **Rules** tab
2. Replace with the following rules:

\`\`\`json
{
  "rules": {
    "typing": {
      "$conversationId": {
        "$userId": {
          ".read": true,
          ".write": "$userId === auth.uid"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

3. Click **Publish**

**Rules Explanation:**
- Path: `/typing/{conversationId}/{userId}`
- Anyone can read typing status (real-time updates)
- Users can only write their own typing status
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect via `onDisconnect()`

### Step 3: Test Connection
Run this in your app to verify:

\`\`\`swift
import FirebaseDatabase

let ref = Database.database().reference()
ref.child("test").setValue("Hello") { error, _ in
    print(error == nil ? "✅ Connected" : "❌ Failed")
}
\`\`\`

---

## Part 2: Firebase Storage

### Step 1: Enable Storage
1. In Firebase Console → **Build** → **Storage**
2. Click **Get Started**
3. Choose storage location (same as Firestore/Realtime DB)
4. Start in **production mode** (rules below will secure it)

### Step 2: Configure Security Rules
1. In Storage console, go to **Rules** tab
2. Replace with:

\`\`\`
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null;
    }
    
    function isValidSize(maxSizeMB) {
      return request.resource.size < maxSizeMB * 1024 * 1024;
    }
    
    function isImage() {
      return request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
    
    match /profile_pictures/{userId} {
      allow read: if isAuthenticated();
      allow write: if isAuthenticated() 
                   && request.auth.uid == userId
                   && isValidSize(5)
                   && isImage();
    }
    
    match /images/{conversationId}/{messageId} {
      allow read: if isAuthenticated();
      allow write: if isAuthenticated()
                   && isValidSize(10)
                   && isImage();
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

3. Click **Publish**

**Rules Explanation:**
- Profile pictures: Max 5MB, users can only upload their own
- Message images: Max 10MB, all authenticated users can upload
- Only image files allowed
- Read access for all authenticated users

### Step 3: Test Upload
\`\`\`swift
import FirebaseStorage

let storage = Storage.storage()
let ref = storage.reference().child("test/test.jpg")
let data = UIImage(systemName: "photo")!.jpegData(compressionQuality: 0.8)!
ref.putData(data) { _, error in
    print(error == nil ? "✅ Upload OK" : "❌ Failed")
}
\`\`\`

---

## Part 3: Xcode Configuration

### Add Firebase SDKs
1. In Xcode: **File** → **Add Package Dependencies**
2. URL: `https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk`
3. Version: 10.0.0 or later
4. Select packages:
   - FirebaseDatabase (Realtime DB)
   - FirebaseStorage (Storage)

### Verify GoogleService-Info.plist
Ensure `GoogleService-Info.plist` includes:
- `DATABASE_URL` (Realtime Database)
- `STORAGE_BUCKET` (Storage)

---

## Monitoring & Limits

### Usage Quotas (Free Spark Plan)
- **Realtime Database:**
  - 1GB stored data
  - 10GB/month downloaded
  - 100 simultaneous connections

- **Storage:**
  - 5GB stored
  - 1GB/day downloaded
  - 20,000/day upload operations

### Monitor Usage
1. Firebase Console → **Usage and billing**
2. Set up billing alerts (recommended)
3. Upgrade to Blaze (pay-as-you-go) if needed

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors
- ✅ Check security rules published
- ✅ Verify user authenticated (`Auth.auth().currentUser != nil`)
- ✅ Check file size within limits

### "Network request failed"
- ✅ Check internet connection
- ✅ Verify Firebase services enabled
- ✅ Check `GoogleService-Info.plist` is current

### Images not loading
- ✅ Check download URLs are valid
- ✅ Verify Storage rules allow read access
- ✅ Check image files exist in Storage console

---

## Security Best Practices

1. ✅ Never use test mode rules in production
2. ✅ Always validate user authentication in rules
3. ✅ Set file size limits
4. ✅ Validate content types
5. ✅ Monitor for unusual activity
6. ✅ Enable App Check for additional security
7. ✅ Rotate Firebase API keys if compromised

# Feature Documentation

## Typing Indicators

### Overview
Real-time typing indicators show when other users are typing in a conversation.

### How It Works
- Uses Firebase Realtime Database for low latency (<500ms)
- Automatically clears after 5 seconds of inactivity
- Debounced to prevent network flooding
- Works in both 1-on-1 and group chats

### Display Format
- 1 user: "Alice is typing..."
- 2 users: "Alice and Bob are typing..."
- 3+ users: "Alice and 2 others are typing..."

### Technical Details
- Database path: `/typing/{conversationId}/{userId}`
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect
- 500ms debounce on typing events
- 5-second timeout

## Image Messages

### Overview
Send and receive images in conversations with automatic compression and offline support.

### Features
- Camera and photo library support
- Automatic compression to ~1MB
- Offline queue (uploads when online)
- Progressive loading with placeholders
- Full-screen viewer with pinch-to-zoom
- Tap to view full size

### Supported Formats
- JPEG, PNG, HEIC
- Max size: 10MB (before compression)
- Compressed to: ~1MB

### How to Send
1. Tap photo icon in message input
2. Choose "Take Photo" or "Choose from Library"
3. Select/capture image
4. Image compresses and sends automatically

### Offline Behavior
