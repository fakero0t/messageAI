# Messaging App MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Vision
This MVP prioritizes **infrastructure reliability over feature breadth**. Success means proving that our messaging architecture can handle real-world conditions: offline users, poor networks, app crashes, and rapid message bursts. A simple chat app with bulletproof message delivery is more valuable than a feature-rich app with unreliable sync.

### Core Value Proposition
Users can trust that their messages will always be delivered—no matter what. Whether they're on 3G, switching networks, or force-quitting the app, messages never get lost.

---

## Technical Stack

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Firebase Firestore**: Real-time database for message storage and sync
- **Firebase Auth**: User authentication and identity management

### iOS Application
- **Swift with SwiftUI**: Native iOS development framework
- **SwiftData**: Local persistence layer for offline message storage
- **URLSession**: HTTP networking layer
- **Firebase SDK**: Firebase client integration

### Deployment
- **TestFlight**: Beta distribution for testing

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. Messaging Core

#### 1.1 One-on-One Chat
- Users can initiate and participate in direct conversations with another user
- Each conversation has a unique identifier
- Messages display in chronological order
- Conversation list shows recent chats with last message preview

#### 1.2 Real-Time Message Delivery
- Messages appear instantly for online recipients (< 1 second latency)
- Leverage Firebase Firestore's real-time listeners for live updates
- No polling—push-based updates only
- Messages sync across all active sessions for the same user

#### 1.3 Local Persistence
- All messages stored locally using SwiftData
- Chat history accessible even when completely offline
- Messages persist through app restarts, device reboots, and crashes
- Local database serves as source of truth until server sync completes

### 2. Message Features

#### 2.1 Message Structure
Each message includes:
- **Content**: Text body (required)
- **Timestamp**: Server-generated creation time
- **Sender ID**: User who sent the message
- **Message ID**: Unique identifier
- **Delivery Status**: Pending, Sent, Delivered, Read
- **Read Receipt**: Timestamp when recipient read the message

#### 2.2 Timestamps
- Display relative time for recent messages ("Just now", "5m ago")
- Show absolute time for older messages ("Yesterday 3:45 PM")
- Use server timestamps to prevent clock skew issues

#### 2.3 Read Receipts
- Track when recipient opens the conversation containing the message
- Display read status to sender ("Read" vs "Delivered")
- Update read status in real-time when recipient reads message

### 3. Reliability & Network Resilience

#### 3.1 Optimistic UI Updates
- Messages appear immediately in sender's chat when "Send" is pressed
- Show visual indicator for pending/unconfirmed messages (e.g., gray checkmark)
- Update UI with delivery confirmation when server acknowledges receipt
- If send fails, show error state and retry option

#### 3.2 Offline Message Queueing
- When device is offline, messages queue locally
- Queue persists in SwiftData (survives app termination)
- Automatic send when connectivity returns
- Maintain send order for queued messages
- Visual indicator showing messages are queued

#### 3.3 Poor Network Handling
- Gracefully handle:
  - 3G/slow connections
  - High packet loss
  - Intermittent connectivity
  - Network switching (WiFi ↔ cellular)
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Show connection status indicator to user
- Continue accepting new messages even when previous messages are pending

#### 3.4 Crash Recovery
- If app crashes mid-send, message still queues for delivery
- On app restart, check for unsent messages and attempt delivery
- No message duplication—use idempotent message IDs

### 4. User Experience

#### 4.1 Online/Offline Status Indicators
- Show user's online status (Active, Away, Offline)
- Update status based on app state and network connectivity
- Display "last seen" timestamp for offline users
- Real-time status updates for conversation participants

#### 4.2 User Interface Requirements
- Clean, modern chat interface
- Message bubbles aligned appropriately (sender: right, recipient: left)
- Smooth scrolling and keyboard handling
- Input field always accessible at bottom
- Auto-scroll to newest message when new message arrives

### 5. Authentication

#### 5.1 Firebase Auth Integration
- Users must authenticate before accessing chat features
- Support email/password authentication minimum
- Persistent login sessions
- Secure token management
- User profile includes: User ID, display name, email

#### 5.2 User Profiles
- Display name visible in chats
- User identifier used for message routing
- Basic profile information accessible to chat participants

### 6. Group Chat

#### 6.1 Multi-Participant Conversations
- Support conversations with 3+ participants
- All group members receive messages in real-time
- Group message history shared among all members
- Member list visible in conversation view

#### 6.2 Group Features
- Create new group conversations
- Add/remove participants (basic implementation)
- Group name/identifier
- Messages delivered to all group members
- Read receipts show who has read the message

### 7. Push Notifications

#### 7.1 Foreground Notifications (Minimum)
- When app is open but user is in different conversation, show notification banner
- Display sender name and message preview
- Tapping notification navigates to conversation

#### 7.2 Background Notifications (Stretch Goal)
- iOS push notifications when app is backgrounded or closed
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration
- Notification payload includes message preview
- Badge count updates on app icon

## Technical Considerations

### Firebase Firestore Schema (Suggested)
```
users/{userId}
  - displayName: string
  - email: string
  - online: boolean
  - lastSeen: timestamp

conversations/{conversationId}
  - participants: array<userId>
  - type: "direct" | "group"
  - lastMessage: timestamp
  - isGroup: boolean

messages/{messageId}
  - conversationId: string
  - senderId: string
  - text: string
  - timestamp: serverTimestamp
  - readBy: array<userId>
  - status: string
```

### SwiftData Models (Suggested)
```swift
@Model
class Message {
    var id: UUID
    var conversationId: String
    var senderId: String
    var text: String
    var timestamp: Date
    var status: MessageStatus
    var readBy: [String]
}

@Model
class Conversation {
    var id: String
    var participants: [String]
    var isGroup: Bool
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var messages: [Message]
}
```

### Network Resilience Strategy
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)
- Max retry attempts before marking message as failed
- Use Firebase offline persistence capabilities
- Monitor network reachability changes
- Queue operations during poor connectivity

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Message Duplication
**Mitigation**: Use UUID-based message IDs generated client-side. Server-side, use Firestore transactions or check for existing message ID before write.

### Risk: Message Ordering Issues
**Mitigation**: Use server-generated timestamps. Sort messages by timestamp, not client-side order. Handle clock skew gracefully.

### Risk: Firebase Costs
**Mitigation**: Monitor Firestore read/write operations. Implement pagination for message history. Cache aggressively. Set up billing alerts.

### Risk: Poor Network User Experience
**Mitigation**: Clear status indicators. Optimistic UI. Transparent retry logic. Offline mode prominently shown.

### Risk: Race Conditions in Group Chats
**Mitigation**: Use Firestore transactions for critical operations. Implement last-write-wins for conflicts. Thorough testing with concurrent updates.
